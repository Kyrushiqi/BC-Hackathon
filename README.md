# Project Overview:
Our project Techberry is centered around helping computer science students with interview prep being provided a resource that pushes them in the right direction when trying to practice both the technical side of the interview along with the behavioral. Any user can use this in desktop view but also as a Google extension for a better user experience where they can use TechBerry while working on problems at the same time. 

When a user wants to work on technical interview prep, they can go into technical mode which helps direct them on potential techniques or algorithms they can use to solve their problems using the typical patterns users might find when working on a problem. This is supposed to help students navigate through tough problems that they might not know where to start from. 

Our Behavioral interview mode integrates AI to help generate behavioral interview questions from various companies. The idea is that the AI generates a response telling us a company with a small description on what they do, values and anything specific to them with a question that they might ask. With this feature, users are able to practice behavioral questions since it is increasingly more popular and does play an important part in the hiring process.
